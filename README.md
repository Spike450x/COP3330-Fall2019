# Object Oriented Programming

Student: Joshua Wood

Professor: Christopher Hollander

Credit Hours: 3

Term: Fall 2019

Course Number & Section: COP 3330

<b>Description</b>

    Object oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, methods, encapsulating, inheritance, interfaces) and the expression of these concepts in the programming languages such as Java.
    
<b>Students will be able to:</b>

    - Apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline; specifically to include the application of mathematics, science and engineering to solve and reason about computational problems.
    - Analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution.
    - Use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practices.
    - Apply mathematical foundations and computer science theory, in particular principles of algorithmic design and complexity analysis, in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices.
    
<b>Expectations of students include:</b>

    - Comprehension of the lecture and reading material will be assessed through knowledge checks incorporated into the textbook.
    - Competency in writing complete Java programs will be assessed through programming assignments. 
    - Mastery of the course material will be assessed through online exams protectored in the EPC.
    - Extra credit may be provided at random intervals through an attendance check
